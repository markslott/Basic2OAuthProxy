Basic Auth to OAuth Java Servlet Proxy for accessing Salesforce REST API
========================================================================

This is a simple Java servlet that will proxy requests to the Salesforce REST API.

This proxy servlet simplifies the authentication process by presenting a simple Basic Authorization method
for passing in credentials rather than having to go through the multistep OAuth flow. This is useful for
integration scenarios where an application needs to integrate with Salesforce, but is not capable of dealing
with OAuth, but can manage HTTP Basic Auth.
